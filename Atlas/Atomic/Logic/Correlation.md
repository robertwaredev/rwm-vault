> In statistics, correlation or dependence is any statistical relationship, whether [[Causality|causal]] or not, between two random variables or bivariate data. Although in the broadest sense, "correlation" may indicate any type of association, in statistics it usually refers to the degree to which a pair of variables are linearly related.
