# Meditation

> Meditation is a practice in which an individual uses a technique – such as [[Mindfulness]], or focusing the mind on a particular object, thought, or activity – to train attention and awareness, and achieve a mentally clear and emotionally calm and stable state.

> Meditation is practiced in numerous religious traditions. The earliest records of meditation (dhyana) are found in the [[Upanishads]], and meditation plays a salient role in the contemplative repertoire of [[Jainism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]]. Since the 19th century, Asian meditative techniques have spread to other cultures where they have also found application in non-spiritual contexts, such as business and health.
