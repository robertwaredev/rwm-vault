> Intuition is the experience of oneself as knowledge. Different fields use the word "intuition" in very different ways, including but not limited to: direct access to unconscious knowledge, unconscious cognition, gut feelings, inner sensing, inner insight to unconscious pattern-recognition, and the ability to understand something instinctively, without any need for conscious reasoning. Intuitive knowledge tends to be approximate.
