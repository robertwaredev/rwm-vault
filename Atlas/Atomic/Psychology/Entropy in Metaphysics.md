Like how entropy grows in the physical sense, it also grows in the metaphysical sense. As human understanding grows, an ever-expanding cascade of interrelated concepts also grows. Each new concept becomes more and more diluted as its "thinkers and doers" become increasingly distanced from the root concepts from which the concept was derived, thus experiencing a form of decay over time and through generations. In an internet connected age, this increasingly results in chaos across many unpredictable fronts in all forms of thinking and doing. Ideas can rapidly co-mingle online, and decay further as people fail to differentiate reality from fiction, then reinject their version of reality back into the collective consciousness, creating a negative feedback loop. Thus it is essential in the modern age to be as multi-faceted as possible to ensure that cross-domain knowledge will foster better informed insight into an endless sea of information at the macro level.

As our perception of reality decays, so does reality. Due to the nature of perception in quantum mechanics, reality is defined by common consensus.
