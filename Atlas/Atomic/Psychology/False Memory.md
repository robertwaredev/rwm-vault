> In [[Psychology]], a false memory is a phenomenon where someone recalls something that did not happen or recalls it differently from the way it actually happened. Suggestibility, activation of associated information, the incorporation of misinformation, and [[source misattribution]] have been suggested to be several mechanisms underlying a variety of types of false memory.
