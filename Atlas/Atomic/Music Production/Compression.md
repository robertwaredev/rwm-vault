> [!TIP] What is compression?
>
> Compression is used to control the [[Dynamic Range|Dynamic Range]] of an audio source. It's most commonly used to create a more even, listenable sound and aid in [[Tonal Balance]].

>> The term "compression" is usually referring to a specific type of [[Dynamic Range]] control called "downwards compression".

# Best Practices

- Not every sound needs compression. Instrument sounds often need it while synthesized sounds may not.
- For general compression aim for 3-6 dB of gain reduction.
- Low frequencies tend to be compressed more than higher frequencies.
- [[Gain|Gain Stage]] using compressor output when making any adjustments.

> *Use automatic gain compensation when possible.*

# Common Uses

- Using downwards compression to reducing audio above a threshold and make loud sounds quieter to create a more even, listenable sound.
- Gluing multiple tracks together with [[Buss Processing|Buss Compression]].

# Creative Uses

- Using [[Upwards Compression]] to boost audio below a threshold and make quiet sounds louder to create a more even, listenable sound.
- Using [[Downwards Expansion]] to reduce audio below a threshold and create a gate effect.
- Using [[Upwards Expansion]] to boost audio above a threshold and create an inverse gate effect.
- Using [[Multiband Compression]] to create frequency-based [[Dynamic Range]] control.

# Useful to Know

- Saturation and [[Compression]] both affect [[Dynamic Range|Dynamic Range]] and therefore can achieve similar goals in the mix.

# Useful Plugins

- The stock compressor that comes with your DAW is great for standard work.
- Use [FabFilter Pro-C 2](https://www.fabfilter.com/products/pro-c-2-compressor-plug-in) for the one of the best all-around compression experiences.
