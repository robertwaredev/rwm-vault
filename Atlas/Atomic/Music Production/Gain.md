> [[Clipping]] - [[Dynamic Range]]

> [!INFO] What is gain?
>
> Gain in audio is a term forÂ the amount of amplification applied to a signal by any process that increases its strength. It's measured in decibels, or dB for short. A good way to think about gain is as the difference in signal strength between the input and the output of an audio system or processor.

> [!INFO] What is gain staging?
>
>Gain staging is the concept of managing volume levels between every effect across your project to prevent [[Clipping]], which causes distortion and affects [[Dynamic Range]].

# Best Practices

- Maintain 1-3 dB of [[Headroom]] between effects.
- Use clip gain to aid in initial gain staging.

# Creative Uses

- Use optional [[Clipping]] at the end of a track's FX chain to catch occasional [[Transients]] that peak too high.
- Intentionally abuse gain levels to create new sounds.

# Useful Plugins

- Use [HoRNet VU Meter](https://www.hornetplugins.com/plugins/hornet-vu-meter-mk4/) to do automatic gain staging with the option to group tracks and sync them simultaneously.
