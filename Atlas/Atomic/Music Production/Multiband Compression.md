> [!TIP] What is multiband compression?
>
> Multiband compression is used to control the [[Dynamic Range]] of an audio source in specific frequency ranges. It's most commonly used to create a more even, listenable sound and aid in [[Tonal Balance]].

# Best Practices

- See [[Compression#^106499|Compression Best Practices]].

# Common Uses

- Controlling [[Dynamic Range]] in specific bands, usually after using normal [[Compression]].
- Using a [[Sidechain]] input to manage [[Frequency Masking]] in specific frequencies.
- Use on busses

# Creative Uses

- Modulating parameters to create emphasis in different sections of a song.

# Useful to Know

- Multiband compression and [[Multiband Saturation]] both affect [[Dynamic Range]] and therefore can achieve similar goals in the mix.

# Useful Plugins

- The stock multiband compressor that comes with your DAW is great for standard work.
 - Use [FabFilter Pro-MB](https://www.fabfilter.com/products/pro-mb-multiband-compressor-plug-in) for one of the best multiband compression experiences.
- [OTT](https://xferrecords.com/freeware), a multiband compressor/expander, is a "flavor" compressor that is predominately used in EDM genres to flatten sounds and change [[Tonal Balance]].
