> [!INFO] What are transients?
>
> A transient is the initial "attack" of a sound. Transient shapers can be used to control the [[Dynamic Range|Dynamics]] of an audio source's transients.

# Best Practices

# Common Uses

- Controlling the attack and sustain of a sound.
- Layering multiple sounds with similar transients by boosting or reducing one of them.

# Creative Uses

- Using [[Dynamic EQ]] to create soft transient shaping.
- Using [[Multiband Compression]] to target and control transient frequency ranges.
