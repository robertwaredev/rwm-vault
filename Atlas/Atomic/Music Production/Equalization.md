> [!INFO] What is EQ?
>
> EQ is used to create gain adjustments within a specific ranges of frequencies, called frequency bands. Static bands don't change gain in reaction to a sound, and are typically used to adjust overall [[Tonal Balance]] and correct consistent problem frequencies.

# Best Practices ^dde8f4

- Make as few EQ moves as possible to do the job.
- Generally use broad Q settings at low frequencies and narrow Q settings at high frequencies.
- Try to keep a band's gain adjustments within about 6 dB when mixing.
- Use cut, bell, or shelf bands to curb unnecessary low and high end.
- [[Gain|Gain Stage]] using EQ output when making any adjustments.

> *Use automatic gain compensation when possible.*

# Common Uses

- Adjusting [[Tonal Balance]] (bright vs. dark).
- Managing [[Frequency Masking]] to create room in the mix.
- Using [[Mid-Side EQ]] to adjust [[Stereo Image]].
- Using [[Left-Right EQ]] to create frequency-based [[Panning]].
- Using [[Dynamic EQ]] to create reactive gain adjustments.

# Creative Uses

- Creating more advanced [[Filtering|Filter]] shapes.
- EQing before and after an effect to create emphasis/de-emphasis.
- Using [[Left-Right EQ]] at the buss level to adjust two hard-panned elements at the same time.
