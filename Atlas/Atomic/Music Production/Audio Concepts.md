> [!TIP] Important concepts
>
> - **Contextual editing** is creating the necessary listening conditions to accomplish your task. For example, EQ work typically requires context of the other tracks in your session that may be conflicting for your decisions to make sense.
>
> - **Purpose-driven creation** is the idea that every decision you make should fulfill an explicit need based on the demands of the song, NOT based on arbitrary structure OR for organizational purposes.
 >
> - **Macro vs. micro** is a doubled sided coin which you have to flip every time you make a decision. Does this choice serve the purpose of the track, a group, or the whole mix? At each level, you have the option to move your choices up or down within that hierarchy to change its scope of control.
