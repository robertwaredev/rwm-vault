> [!INFO] What are modulation effects?
> Modulation effects change a sound by adding a time-delayed version of the sound to itself, and then varying the size of that delay over time.
>
> - **How long** the delay is (10 milliseconds vs. 150 milliseconds)
> - **How quickly** it varies (changing once per second vs. changing several times a second)
> - **How** it varies (changing smoothly vs. jumping randomly)
> - **How many** delayed versions are added (one vs. several)

# Common Modulation FX

> [[Delay]] - [[Echo]] - [[Reverb]] - [[Phaser]] - [[Flanger]] - [[Chorus]] - [[Ensemble]]

# Best Practices

- Use after [[Compression]] and [[Equalization|EQ]] stages.

# Common Uses

- Creating width, ambience, and phase based effects.
- Adding "vibe."

# Creative Uses

- Apply modulation effects to other modulation fx to get more interesting and diverse results. For example, using a flanger on your delay can drastically change its flavor and use cases.
