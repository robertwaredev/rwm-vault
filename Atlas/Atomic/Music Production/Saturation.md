> [!TIP] What is saturation?
> Saturation is a subtle form of [[Distortion]] that adds pleasant-sounding warmth through introducing higher order [[The Harmonic Series|Harmonics]]. Common types of saturation include tape, tubes, transistors, and circuits.

# Best Practices

- Diversify saturation types across a production.
- Use smooth and warm saturation types on low end, and spicy types on high end.
- Be wary of using too much, as the natural byproduct of saturation is higher order [[The Harmonic Series|Harmonics]], which will create more competition for space in your mix.

# Common Uses

- Warming or thickening up a sound.
- Acting as a sort of preamp before your other audio effects, especially with tube saturation.

# Creative Uses

- Acting as a sort of soft [[Clipping|Clipper]] towards the end of your FX chain which you can drive gain into.
- Automating the drive in certain sections of your song to create different levels of energy or tension.
- Using [[Multiband Saturation]] to create algorithm-based [[The Harmonic Series|Harmonics]] in specific frequency ranges.

# Useful to Know

- Saturation and [[Compression]] both affect [[Dynamic Range]] and therefore can achieve similar goals in the mix.
