> [!INFO] What is phase?
>
> Essentially, phase refers to sound waves — or simply put, the vibration of air. When we listen to sound, what we're hearing are changes in air pressure. Just like the ripple of a stone in water, sound is created by the movement of air.
>
> Each ripple, or waveform, has a positive part and a negative part. The positive part of the waveform tells your speaker cone how far to move outwards, and the negative part tells your speaker cone how far to move inwards. Therefore air is being vibrated in and out according to the shape of a waveform.
>
> If we imagine that the length of every waveform has a range from 0 - 360, the phase would refer to the position along the length of the waveform that a sound begins to play back at.
