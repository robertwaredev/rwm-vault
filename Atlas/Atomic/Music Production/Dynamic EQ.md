> [!INFO] What is Dynamic EQ?
>
> Dynamic EQ is used to create reactive gain adjustments within specific frequency bands. Dynamic bands add or remove gain in reaction to a sound, and are typically used to correct problem frequencies that only appear sometimes, such as on certain notes or in certain sections of a song.

# Best Practices

- See [[Equalization#^dde8f4|EQ Best Practices]].
- Start with at least +/- 1.5 dB of dynamic gain to hear the change it makes.

# Common Uses

- Creating reactive gain adjustments that controlling resonances, sibilance, and plosives.
- Using a [[Sidechain]] input to manage [[Frequency Masking]] in specific frequencies.

# Creative Uses

- Emphasizing [[Dynamic Range]] in specific bands, usually after other effects.
- Using dynamic [[Mid-Side EQ]] bands to emphasize [[Stereo Image]] in the mids or sides.
- Using dynamic [[Left-Right EQ]] bands to emphasize [[Panning]] on the left or right.
- Using [[Dynamic EQ]] to create soft transient shaping.
