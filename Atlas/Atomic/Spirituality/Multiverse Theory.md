> The multiverse is a hypothetical group of multiple universes. Together, these universes comprise everything that exists: the entirety of space, time, matter, energy, information, and the physical laws and constants that describe them. The different universes within the multiverse are called "parallel universes", "other universes", "alternate universes", or "many worlds".

> The first to whom we can definitively attribute the concept of innumerable worlds are the Ancient Greek [[Atmoism|Atomists]], beginning with [[Leucippus]] and [[Democritus]] in the 5th century BCE, followed by [[Epicurus]] (341-270 BCE) and [[Lucretius]] (1st century BCE). In the third century BCE, the philosopher [[Chrysippus]] suggested that the world eternally expired and regenerated, effectively suggesting the existence of multiple universes across time.
