> The Upanishads are [[late Vedic]] [[Sanskrit]] texts that supplied the basis of later Hindu philosophy. They are the most recent part of the [[Vedas]], the oldest scriptures of Hinduism, and deal with meditation, philosophy, consciousness, and ontological knowledge; earlier parts of the Vedas deal with mantras, benedictions, rituals, ceremonies, and sacrifices. While among the most important literature in the history of Indian religions and culture, the Upanishads document a wide variety of "rites, incarnations, and esoteric knowledge" departing from Vedic ritualism and interpreted in various ways in the later commentarial traditions. Of all Vedic literature, the Upanishads alone are widely known, and their diverse ideas, interpreted in various ways, informed the later traditions of [[Hinduism]].

> The Upanishads are commonly referred to as [[Vedānta]]. Vedānta has been interpreted as the "last chapters, parts of the Veda" and alternatively as "object, the highest purpose of the Veda". The aim of all Upanishads is to investigate the nature of [[Ātman]] (self), and "direct the enquirer toward it."
