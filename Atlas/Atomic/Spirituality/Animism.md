> Animism (from Latin: anima meaning 'breath, spirit, life') is the belief that objects, places, and creatures all possess a distinct spiritual essence. Animism perceives all thingsâ€”animals, plants, rocks, rivers, weather systems, human handiwork, and in some cases words, as animated and alive. Animism is used in anthropology of religion as a term for the belief system of many Indigenous peoples, in contrast to the relatively more recent development of organized religions. Animism focuses on the [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] universe, with a specific focus on the concept of the immaterial soul.

> Although each culture has its own mythologies and rituals, animism is said to describe the most common, foundational thread of indigenous peoples' "spiritual" or "supernatural" perspectives.
