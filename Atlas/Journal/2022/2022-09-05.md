1:00 am - Still Obsidianing. It's getting obsessive, but it feels productive somehow.

3:35 pm - Still Obsidianing. It's almost 4:00 pm and I haven't accomplished much else aside from "linking my thinking." I gotta chill on this stuff before it consumes my every waking thought. I did sleep well last night, though, so maybe offloading my thoughts is actually helping.

10:09 pm - Getting late again, all obsidian all day. I'm making headway with my confused and large repository of shit in my head.
