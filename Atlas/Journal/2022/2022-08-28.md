Wake up, take a brush and put a little makeup, and by makeup I mean copious amounts of coffee.

Actually finishing work for Nick today - two days behind but I got it done.

Figuring out how to use this fucking software is driving me crazy and costing me time.

Maybe I'm getting it. Life is weird right now and I tend to think I'm losing my mind. or rapidly developing some high tier mental disorder. Could just be the stress.

Gonna watch a show maybe while I go to sleep.
