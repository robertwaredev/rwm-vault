12:40 am - It's late, and I'm up fucking with Obsidian.
1:02 am - It's late as fuck and I'm still obsessing over Obsidian. Making progress, though. I think.
7:51 pm - I feel like nothing ever works and at any moment everything could come crashing down. It sucks ass
9:16 pm - converting most of my my notion setup to obsidian. If I can find a dedicated financial tracking app for desktop, I might leave notion altogether.
10:01 pm - I can't get it together for like five minutes, so distracted all of the time.
