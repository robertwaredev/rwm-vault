7:30 pm - Moving day is tomorrow. It's going to be raining, so hopefully that won't pose too much of an issue. I still can't seem to decide how I feel about this. On one hand, I'm excited to finally be living with my best friends and have the opportunity to see the ceiling of what we're capable of collectively go way up. On the other hand, this is going to be the most challenging period of my life so far, financially, socially, emotionally. The true test of my capabilities lays before me.
