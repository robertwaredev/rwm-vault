12:08 am - Things are feeling a bit better today. Whatever I have going on mentally feels like I'm permanently on a psychedelic that I can't un-take. It has its ups and downs. My perception of reality is rapidly changing and I don't like it.

1:03 am - going to sleep.

8:11 am - it's a bit earlier than I normally wake up, didn't sleep well last night.

10:12 am - Despite the half-sleep, I'm not feeling the worst today. I think I was giving myself a hard time for taking so much time to learn how to use use notion, only to realize I didn't like it, then finding obsidian and having to learn that. overall I think obsidian is better for me long-term.

2:08 pm - I'm finding it harder to find a reason to fuck around in obsidian, which, sadly, is a good thing. The less time I spend fiddling with setting and appearances, the better. I just need a system that works more than anything, and this seems to be going well.

5:20 pm - Obsidian aint shit, I've got this program by the balls!

10:55 pm - Smoking more weed. I did nothing today but Obsidian. Worth it? I don't know. Hopefully it will help make me feel sane. It's like proof of my existence, and ownership of it, in a way.
