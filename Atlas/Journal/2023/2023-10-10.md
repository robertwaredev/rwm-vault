# Morning Pages

Another day. It's noon. Last night's episode was a lot of fun. I guess today it's back to the remix to try to get that finished soon. Today's where the real work begins. Remembering the Kronos theme, which is good. Sleepnet too. The inspirations I have for this remix are pretty wild. Deifinitely feels like I'm doing the carry on this one, but that's okay, I know Kristaav doesn't have a lot of time. Much to be done yet. Coffee is on the pot, nothing else really stopping me now. My right wrist feels bruised for unexplainable reasons. Aftereffect of burning myself accidentally the other day? Maybe from the wditing session? Like carpal tunnel made its way down the arm.
