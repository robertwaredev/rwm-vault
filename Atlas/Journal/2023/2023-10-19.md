# Morning Pages

Morning again. It's 12:33 pm and it's hot as fuck in my room. I get the feeling this remix is not going to be finished by my deadline. Kristaav just told me in a dream that the melody sucks. I like it, but maybe that first half doesn't hit hard enough. The second quarter in particular. I don't really want to work on it today, but there's only really three days left before our deadline. I want to play video games instead, what else is new? I'm at a conflict now of what to do. I have nothing useful to do other than work on the remix, which I'm getting burned out on to be honest. I need to find some inspirational material to work with. Some Sleepnet will help, I think. It's already helping. I don't know why I don't listen to music very often. As a music producer, this is quite the conundrum. Perhaps why I've neglected to release music for so long. Or, a contributing factor, at the very least. I should create a mood board for music. How can I create visuals and an environment that engages me to create? That takes me on the same mental journey as playing my favorite games? Definitely the retro-futurism aesthetic in Caves of Qud and now Moonring is really what I'm into right now. I realized my knife's screws are T6, and I just bought a T6 to repair my Steam Controller, so I fixed my knife just now after literal years of abuse. Feels good man. Now listening to the Armajet OST from Noisia. Fantastic stuff, I forgot how dope. Definitely stuff I gotta reference more.
