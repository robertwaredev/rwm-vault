# Morning Pages

Morning again. Gotta pee, gonna do that first. Freestyle Fridays is today, which means I have to go help cover the event. I've never even been to one, but that's fine, gotta show out to support the boys. Not really too sure what to expect to be honest. If someone tries to make me freestyle rap I'm gonna fucking swing. What else is going down? Basically nothing, another day of waiting for Lex. Not sure exactly how I'm supposed to remain productive at all during this period, though. I'm doing my best not to stagnate, keep the brain moving and whatnot. I think this heatmap plguin is going to be of a lot of use, just need to figure out more things that can reasonably be tracked in such a way. So far the the journal file size tracker is pretty cool, I must say. There's a pretty solid chance that when I go downstairs that there will be no weed left, which sucks and throws off the routine slightly. I've also never had poutine, which is occurring to me for absolutely no good reason at all. Maybe I should integrate poutine into the routine, then it won't be a problem! That actually sounds like a song title, hold on. Okay, wrote it down. Seems I may have lost a few bullets on my music ideas note. Could be that my missing EP titles are still in Notion, though. Back at it, it is now 1:02 pm. In the garage chilling, waiting on Kristaav to get back with groceries. The brain is very weird today. Not sure if I just have nothing to work out, or if I'm having trouble forming clear thoughts. I think the last few days have been pretty effective at getting me through the recent job thing. Having to treat the possibility of getting it as a reality is forcing me to figure out ways I can start to get my life back in order. My discipline. Utilize this new resolve, and try to nurture it into something more sustainable. As I'm typing this, even, it sounds like fiction. Stop idealizing and rationalizing so much and jump into action. It's the only way to move forward. It's a step into the deep end of the pool. This will set the stage for my thirties, though, which is wide and filled with interesting and particular individuals, and more new opportunities than I'm sure I'm capable of thinking of at present. I never could have imagined this podcast leading me down such an interesting path. The possibilities are too many, best not to overthink it. I've already gone over every minimum and maximum for every outcome, everything in between can be reasonably estimated. I'm ready for this. It feels like I'm waiting on some kind of timeline merge or something. I'm sitting here watching what's happening around me, much as I normally do, but everything feels *different,* as if this time the movie is more movie-like, as if this may be the last time I see this place, which is nonsense. I'm prepared to move as the job needs, but I feel like I'll always pay for a room in the Zude House so I can come back whenever I'm able. I'll probably just end up living here for the foreseeable future, though, and doing my work remotely. I'm trying to manifest this so fucking hard. Whoever I become, nothing can take away the accomplishment of making it this far. I am certain that this is not the final stop of the journey for me, though. I always felt I was born to do great things, or at the very least couldn't understand why others around me aspired to so little, and I suppose slowly, eventually, I became like them in a lot of ways. I never changed completely, there's always that part of me that remains pure. I'm learning how to grow that bigger and stronger day by day. Some focus and resolution would go a long way, but I've always been a big proponent of letting nothing get in your way. When I'm resolved, that's true. Right now I'm resolved to hope and pray to the gods, whichever of them might exist, that this job comes through. Resolved to force myself to believe, to act as if it's the inevitable. The power of belief truly is some quantum-level manipulation. It can't be manipulated directly, though. It's like only being able to see something when looking from the corner of your eye, indirect observation is required. In other words, you cannot falsely manipulate the universe, you *must truly believe* and do everything you know to do in order to aid the path. The intent you seek to manifest must brew in the subcincious, and only that which is sowed with the passion and fury driven by belief takes root and spreads, effecting behavioural changes which sort your perceptions of reality into an ever clearer picture of the truth. The belief must be aided by agency and action. The agency to make difficult and complex decisions for yourself, and the will to do something about it. We will make this happen. Stop being so anxious. All good things take time. I should get Nick Tello on the podcast at some point, if that's even going to be a possibility moving forward. Maybe if I can work him into an episode before I start the job. Gotta shit again, I think. Nice.

# Notes

- Freestyle Fridays is in like 90 minutes. I've never been to one so I'm naturally rather nervous. We're doing the usual pop up interviews with people that show up. Same as any other pop up I suppose. I should eat first.
