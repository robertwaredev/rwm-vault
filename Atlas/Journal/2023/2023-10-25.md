# Morning Pages

Morning. Afternoon, technically. I'm awake, though. Haven't worked on the remix in a few days, it feels like I'm the only one that actually cared to finish the song. After Kristaav realized that the only way for the song to get finished is if I take the team carry, it seems like he checked out entirely. Hasn't said a thing about it. It's not as though he could have produced this on his own, he couldn't produce his way out of a paper bag if he tried. Of course if we do end up doing a video, he won't involve himself in the edit it all, almost a guarantee. Just feels like these days Eli is the only one with any convictions or belief in his own abilities, aside from me, and he's the most indecisive one usually. Whatever. Today sounds like a nice day to pretend like reality doesn't exist and play video games all day. I'm stuck in some grief pattern again. At first I grieved the loss of my current self, everything was about to change for me. Then I grieved for the child in me who was always made to feel worthless and invalid, for someone had finally seen my worth. Then I grieved for the opportunity, as so much time had passed with no contact that I began to believe It was all just a dream, or that I didn't make the cut. Then I grieved for my current life again, which at this point was half buried in an act of transition and now needed to be dug back up and treated as if nothing had happened. Then I got the email. Then I grieved once more for my current self, who had been buried, unburied, and now needed to be buried again. I also grieved for the child in me once more, for this time I had allowed myself to feel valuable and then took that away from and admonished *myself* when I thought I no longer deserved it. Now it's been a month to the day with no word, and the grief reversal is happening for the fourth time. I'm emotionally devastated. This is exactly the reason I can't live normally. The strength of these feelings take place over the course of years or decades for most people, for me they happen over the course of days and weeks. The suicidal thoughts are back in some small measure. Mostly as an escape mechanism in an attempt to avoid feeling all of this grief. What am I supposed to do? Waiting it out has proven to be innefective. Following up has proven to be a waste of time. I don't feel like I'm being treated like a human being through this process. No consideration for my situation or value of my time whatsoever. How many iterations of myself do I have to go throuhgh before all of this is over? The tiger blanket on my wall is looking at me with disapproval. For a minute I thought I've been so tired recently do to weather, but I just woke up from a 12 hour sleep and I still dont want to get out of bed. The dissociation is still present. The eyes still have difficulty focusing. Maybe I'm actually dying of some disease I don't know about. I haven't been to a doctor in over 10 years.
