# Morning Pages 

12:09 pm - watched The Color Out of Space last night, what a fucked movie. Of course I'm now woken up by more loud movies playing. Despite everyone falling asleep into last night's movie ten minutes into the damn thing. I have to release this stupid fucking song today, which I barely have the capacity to give a shit about anymore. I'm not proud of how that final mix turned out to be honest, it feels so dry and boring. I hate that we did this, cause now I'm jaded all over again by not being able to do what I wanted with it in the time that I had. No time to record a video today now, I asked Kristaav to wake me up in the morning so we could film, but that clearly did not happen and isn't going to. So I either make a reel by myself and risk him feeling butthurt about it, or I do nothing yet again. I'm more fucking annoyed than anything that he asked me to do this and then put in literally two half sessions of effort into it. His fucking girlfriend is here every god damn day of the week, yet he cannot seem to spare the time for a literal career investment we agreed to collaborate on and release with some amount of decorum, it's a joke to him I guess. I'm not going out of my way to try to force people to participate. You show up if you want to, and clearly that's not what he wanted. I don't care. Not anymore. I'll do it myself, fuck it.
