# Morning Pages

It's morning again. Day one back on digital journaling. Woke up with Mac Miller in my head, so there are worse things. Obsidian mobile is chill, but I realize now that typing with a touch screen might have its problems. Auto correct is going to have to help me out here. Now I'm thinking about god damn honcho ponchos, thank you Ben Rector. *In the rain, do they wear honcho ponchos?* The answer is probably yes. Another day of waiting on Lex to get back to me. Truly frustrating, but nothing to be done about it, really. Woke up a bit late again, it's a bit past eleven. All sorts of random shit floating through my brain this morning. Now Coheed. Why so many different songs at once? That's unreasonable and shouldn't be allowed. Who is the CEO of thinking, cause I'm gonna need to have a word. Or have a thought, really. I keep putting off reading more of this dang old book, or at least the time and the thought to do it seem to slip by easily. I need a fucking girlfriend already. Someone helping me to keep myself accountable wouldn't be the worst thing ever. After I'm settled in at this new job, the search begins. I can finally shoot for exactly the kind of women I want. Nothing will be the same. Shoot, ya boy might even end up married someday. All of this suffering has to pay off at some point, right? This has to be the threshold I've been waiting to cross my entire life, right? I'm gonna have to ask Lex why his email pipeline is so damn slow. They gotta be fucking with me, right? I'm not even that slow at replying to emails. Maybe he's slammed with other shit? Maybe they're prepping onboarding? Maybe they're just slow. It is a possibility. All I know is that I'm currently in the dark and I really don't fucking like it. It's need to know. *I need to know*. I need to know that it's okay for me to invest time in other things because I didn't get it, ot that it's fine to be slowing down before things get really difficult. Not knowing leads to indecision, which leads to anxiety. How many days can I go like this? Email is checked every day now. Hypervigilance is now mandatory. I'm sure everything is going according to plan. Just don't let it get to you. You're good at partitioning parts of yourself away for when they are needed, that's how you got here to begin with. Like being under duress. Anyway, I've ranted too long on this. Much else to do today. Probably going to play some No Man's Sky or some more Caves of Qud, or both. Let's see what the brings me.

## Affirmations

- I'm that nigga.
- I'm gonna kill this job opportunity.

## Blurts

# Notes

- The Obsidian Vault feels fresh and new again. Plugins get better and I'm more willing to learn how to use the more complicated ones that enhance bits of my life. Key one today being Heatmap Calendar.
- I should get a keyboard for the tablet when I get the chance, the on-screen keyboard isn't great for morning writing sessions.
