# Morning Pages

I'm getting really fucking sick of this. Lex needs to hurry the fuck up, my bag is severely being fucked with because of this. If I'm not onboarded by the end of the month I'm not sure I can reasonably continue waiting around. I can't, actually. I can't have all of my opportunities to make money ruined because I'm expected to be hired and not have the time to complete other projects. This is so fucking stupid. Just send me a fucking emails saying it'll be in two weeks, or two months, or not at all. That way I can accomplish other things in the meantime. I really don't think that's too much to ask for. If this is the level of communication that is typical for them, then I really don't want the job. The anxiety is not worth any amount of money. I'll give it until the 15th before I hit the frustrated follow up email. So stupid. I wonder if I'd be able to call his email directly or if that's even possible. All I know is that I wouldn't tolerate this from literally anyone else. I almost want to take the job and then leave them hanging out to dry just to be petty. Again, though, the power struggles are meaningless, and eventually get swept away like sand. No point would be proven. I feel like I'm throwing messages in bottles into the ocean and somehow expecting them to be received. I hope the ocean opens up and swallows me whole. Would easier then all of this waiting. Fuck this shit, I'm gonna go have a smoke and get on with my day. Dwelling is what got me lilke this to begin with.
