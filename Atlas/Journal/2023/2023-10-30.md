# Morning Pages 

Started playing Songs of Syx again last night, it's really coming along. Getting close to 1.0 release and it honestly sucked me in for hours. A more casual and yet more grand scale game. The aesthitic is right up my alley too. Definitely playing more today before the show. We got Shannon Battle on tonight.
