# Morning Pages

Morning. It's past noon and it's like 90 degrees in my room. WAY too fucking hot, how do I sleep through this? Got "Still Into you" stuck in my head, of course. I've got so little in my head right now that it bounces around easily. Still no word from Lex. I'm gonna be fine until then, but I'm so tired of sitting on my hands. I feel like I've seen something that few people ever see and now I've had to return home and keep quiet. Hard not to let that thing you saw occupy your mind constantly. Like if I was sent on a mission to another planet through a secret portal and experienced things far outside the realm of the normal, then returned to the mundanity of every day life. I have an opportunity now that no one I know has ever had. To be a part of one of the most well respected shows on the internet, even if only in some small capacity in the grand scheme of things. I wish I had better mechanisms to deal with extended periods of waiting like this. I'm so used to just *doing* all of the time. I should work some form of meditation into this new daily routine I'm writing up, help myself with the long term center of self. Work on my presence in the moment. That's another thing about waiting that is a problem for me, I get lost in repeating thoughts of anticipation, which throws me out the the now. So much about the flow state feels like dissociation to me, though. Probably some scientific truth behind that. How do I rewire my brain such that the flow state is a present and conscious activity? Is that even possible, or desirable? I should quit smoking weed, give myself a proper chance to actually find out. Maybe that's why music is so important, it's a merger of dissociative flow state and present experience. Last night felt like I was extra present, or perhaps that's just my natural inclination around a lot of people. By myself it's so easy to get lost in my head. Perhaps today I could prepare for that song Kristaav and I are supposed to start tomorrow.
