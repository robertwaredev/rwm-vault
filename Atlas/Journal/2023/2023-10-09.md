# Morning Pages

It's not really morning anymore, but here I am. It's about three, woke up at around one. Zudecast episode today, the Halloween horror icon battle royale. Just finished making the board for that. Started an Exorcist remix with Kristaav yesterday and it's turning out to be some of the most savage shit that I've ever written. I'd say I genuinely have about a week to finish this up and release it before Halloween comes and the New Exorcist movie drops. The hype for this one could be big to be honest. Once again, another day with no word from Lex. I know there's a lot going on right now, but damn. This marks ten days since my follow up. I hope it's not always like this. Not sure what to do with the rest of my day before the show. I should probably tap into the remix again, but I think I'll wait until tomorrow so that I can get another full day of flow in. If we do the reels for it right, it'll easily go viral. I'm just hoping no one else is doing a similar thing right now. I mean, mine would definitely end up being the sicker version, but less competition is always better. Got the Kronos theme stuck in my head, what a fucking masterclass of a song. Definitely going to take some nods from that for the remix. I need Kristaav in on this like every day though, if we're going to finish this as a real collaborative effort.
