# Morning Pages

Good morning USA. We really out here. Indeed another day has passed, the sun rising and falling as it has for billions of years. Chatted with mom yesterday about the job, money, food, and Obsidian. I'm glad certain key concepts are starting to click for her, and the realization that there is in fact no system being imposed here, as all other pieces of software tend to want you to use it in a specific way for best results. Obsidian is what you make of it, and figuring that out is the real 'aha' moment. I've neglected reading The Artist's Way for an extra week. It seems like my ability to sit down and read for half an hour or longer comes in waves every two weeks. I don't think I'm in the mood for it today, but I'll make a point to pick it back up on Sunday. Started playing Minecraft again yesterday, although I'm not 100% sure why. I guess I needed something a little more open ended to play for when I burn out on No Man's Sky. Maybe I should give the Create mod another chance? It would probably be a lot more interesting that whatever has been added to the vanilla experience since the last time I played.
