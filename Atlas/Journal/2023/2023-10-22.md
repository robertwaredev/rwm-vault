# Morning Pages

1:06 am, about five minutes ago I was walking into the studio, and I glanced past my grandma's old recliner and there was someone sitting in it. I was mostly looking down to make sure I didn't stub my toe, but the living room was fully lit, so my peripheral vision was as good as it's gonna get. I did my usual 0.5 second cursory glance to visually assess the room is empty before moving on right as I was crossing the threshold into the studio. Someone was definitely there. At first it didn't really mean much, as I assumed it was Eli because he usually sits there. Then I realized he went to sleep three hours ago, and I had seen that his door was closed in the way in. Kristaav is still outside as I write this, and Christian is still on tour, which means that either I'm hallucinating full on people, or that I've encountered something that is only seen when it wishes to be. Both are frightening prospects.

12:25 pm, Just woke up, for some reason the sky is super dark right now. It's practically night time in my room. CitizenCon day 2 is today, big hype. Yesterday's panels were NUTS.
