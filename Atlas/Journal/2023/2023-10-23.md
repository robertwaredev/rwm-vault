# Morning Pages

10:15 am and I'm awake. Unusual. CitizenCon this past weekend has been absolutely massive. Faith restored to the highest capacity. Squadron 42 looked brilliant, perhaps the most beautiful characters and environments I've ever seen in a game before. It felt like coming home, finally. This community is about to become unstoppable, and everything we've been hoping for and dreaming of is finally coming. 2024 is the year for Star Citizen, no doubt anymore. This changes the face of video gaming forever, and I hope Todd Howard is shitting his pants after this. Chris Roberts is the new golden child, and the fact that Starfield has been a massive disappointment to most, and only a couple months beforehand really drives home how much of a success this year truly was for Chris and Star Citizen fans everywhere. Almost finished the remix yesterday. Kristaav was *barely* helpful on this session. It essentially amounted to four hours of noodling and indecision trying to re-write a section of the song that was already written. It basically sounds the same with a slightly different chord progression and melody. I'm not gonna lie, I'm rather frustrated by the lack of effort that he put into this. Or perhaps the lack of forethought or ability to translate that musically. Whatever it was, I'm sick of artists that can supposedly vamp a dozen different ideas while "goofing off" but when it comes time to record, their confidence and ability to think goes out the window and everything becomes a series of "I don't knows" and unfulfilled snippets of ideas that that they abandon playing halfway through a recorded fucking take. I'm so over it. He literally could not even play if I was watching the screen as it was recording, I had to put my head down on the table to get anything to happen. If he doesn't bring the heat today I'm not sure we should do another song after this. Can't even compare this to the number of paid sessions I've done where I've been fully expected to come up with ideas on the spot, both musical and technical, that make sense, are functional, and then implement them into a song straight away. I have zero sense of there being a possibility of failure, or that it won't be liked or good enough. Perhaps I'm an intimidating producer to work with based solely on skill, but that's not only not my problem, but also not something that I try to project or am really able to change. Regardless, I *am* excited for this song. It is some of the best material I've made. But at least now I know I do in fact have the best songwriting sensibilities out of everyone I know, except maybe Nick. Sounds like Christian just got home from tour. Should probably get my day moving now. This was needed, though, it's been a few days since I wrote this much.
