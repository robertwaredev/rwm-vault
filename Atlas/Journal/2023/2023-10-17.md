# Morning Pages

Morning, had to force myself awake just now. Clearly dreaming about something interesting. It is currently 12:15 pm. Found a game called Moonring last night that I'm now obsessed with. It's got the Caves of Qud vibes with a more populated world and a focus on being an RPG rather than a roguelike. The dialogue system is super cool and reminiscient of Ultima, but the one bad thing is that it doesn't like the Steam software keyboard. Doesn't pick it up whatsoever.
