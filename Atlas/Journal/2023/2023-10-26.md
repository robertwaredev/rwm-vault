# Morning Pages 

6:18 pm - It is NOT morning, but last night's party was more fun than it necessarily had reason to be. I'm still hungover from it, but getting to talk to Koko in person again was actually much needed despite my initial anxiety about it. I don't think I fully processed before how much it actually hurt me not having her around. I clearly can't do anything about that, not that I even have an idea of what that would look like. I keep making myself fully vulnerable to people and it hurts just as much, if not worse every subsequent time someone just walks away. So why do I keep doing this? Is it the "right" thing to do?
