# Livestream Ideas

- Creating supersaws in Phase Plant
- Turn white noise into cymbals using Snap Heap/Multipass

# General Ideas

- [ ] Mix synths only in mono
    - [ ] Pro-MB the sides using the mid as sidechain when they fall below a threshold. Goal is to match side’s freq response to the mid’s freq response, then mix it in to achieve a more balanced mix and phase correlation.
    - [ ] Mix entire side band lower than mid
- [ ] Use the mid of one sound and the side of another
- [ ] Tremolo modulated on reverb sweeps
