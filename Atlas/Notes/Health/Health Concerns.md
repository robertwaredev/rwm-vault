# Notes

[[2022-09-11]] 12:54 am - I had some sort of mini seizure again. This sometimes seems to happen within a minute of drinking water. Not sure if correlated.

[[2022-09-21]] 7:28 pm - The pain in my abdomen is getting worse. I'm having severe physical stress and panic attacks are much worse.

[[2023-04-23]] lowkey seizure. Laying in bed, feet hurt. Suddenly get cold and shaking uncontrollably. In total maybe five mins.

[[2023-08-28]] I carried a bunch of heavy shit up a hill last night and I pinched a nerve in my right middle finger I think, it's been numb for almost 20 hours now. Nice.

	[[2023-10-05]] Follow up, I think the nerves in the tip of my right middle finger are just dead now, but just the very tip. I'd never notice it unless I was poking something underneath it, to clean under my nails for example.
