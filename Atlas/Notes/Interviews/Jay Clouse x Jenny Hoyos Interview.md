# Benchmarks

- Story + twist
- Analyze your stats
- 5th grade reading level or below
	- Readability Formulas (website)
- 90% + retention = viral
- EVERY second counts
- First frame should be identifiable as your content
- 34 seconds is secret sauce?
- Save the payoff until the literal last second

# Idea Generation

- Watch videos, duh.
- What would I want to watch?
- Life / experiences
- Chat GPT / AI

# Picking Ideas

- Narrow list down survivor style
- Do I really want to make the idea?
- Logistically possible?
- Solid hook? Solid momentum?
	- Set the expectation
	- Hook, foreshadowing
	- Smooth dialogue transition to break pace

		> "So we had a TON of ideasâ€¦"

	- This - but, therefore
	- Resolve expectations with a twist
- Is it rewatchable?
- Is it shareable?
- What's the viral aspect?

# Audience

- Your younger self
- Specific people you know in the target demographic, what they might enjoy, or how they might become interested in the topic.

# Platforms

- Short form platforms are not the same as should be treated differently.
- Crossposting videos doesn't really work, every platform wants different things.

## Youtube

- slower pace, mature, story

## IG Reels

- visual, mature, shareable

## TikTok

- short, information dense

# Takeaways

- Retention isn't king, viewer satisfaction is.
