# Notes

> **What’s my “if, then” question or premise?**

> **What value am I providing?**

## Main Points

- Breakdown [[Atlas/Scripts/The Most Important Tool for Creative People]]

# Hook

> *Exasperated, chaotic, frenetic vibe.*

The #1 secret to becoming a genius music producer is *context.*

# Body

> *Walking really fast, but not jogging.*

Context is the useful information we get out of comparing and contrasting two or more things for desired results.

> *Still moving, different locations for every question*

Context requires us to have a question in mind, like:

> *Sad wojack hugging meme*

Is my kick and sub relationship solid?

> *Extreme close up on my midrange*

How much midrange is *too much* midrange?

> *Footage of nuclear bomb going off*

Do positive LUFS values exist?

> *Maniacal laughing, wipes tear.*

Yes. Yes, they do.

Are they categorized as a crime against humanity?

> Robert is not my real name

To all of the which, the answer could be a resounding “Yes!”

> *Unnecessary turn, Windows XP hills wallpaper*

But *your* music *sucks* because *you're* struggling for context.

> *Unnecessary turn, zoom in. Runescape footage.*

*Here’s a super secret tip!*

> *Crouching down, camera on ground.*

Inspiration is completely fucking useless…

> *Angle switch, *

…*unless* you extract little bits o' knowledge along the way and *make sure* you can reuse them later.

> *Angrily, pointing at background*

Set yourself up to solve one problem at a time.

> *Close up, concerned look.*

Solve the easiest problem, actually.

> *Relieved, as if I narrowly avoided having to fuck someone up.*

If there's an easier way, then *do that.* Straight away. Then *keep doing that.*

The moment your flow state fizzles out is the moment your inspiration has surpassed your ability to create due to the limitations of your knowledge.

> *Dismissively, be a man attitude.*

Now *remember that* and apply it to your whole fucking life.
