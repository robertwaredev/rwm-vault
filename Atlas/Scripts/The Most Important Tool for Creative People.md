# Hook #Review

If you’re an artist, music producer, or create *things* of any kind, then there's a high likelihood that you've struggled to consistently be inspired to create without inevitably getting burned out for long periods of time. Weeks, months, or in my case *years* of burnout can cause you to drop a creative pursuit entirely and attempt to become a backend web developer, ship out on a seasonal oil rigging job, or change lightbulbs at the top of communications towers.

If you feel like sometimes you create at the highest tier in your field or space, and other times you feel fully levelled down to being a complete beginner again, my guess is that you've perhaps unknowingly developed a bad habit of waiting for intuition or clarity to guide you to take action.

If you've been a creator for a while, you'll probably agree that it's lack of action and not lack of knowledge that blocks inspiration from forming. In fact, too much knowledge can feel like an inspiration killer at times. Option overload. Lack of knowledge can be one of the most inspiring circumstances to find yourself in, because it creates an invisible path for you to follow with many things to discover along the way, which you walk along with an eager focus, both for the sake of the journey and the destination.

For me, investing a disproportionate amount of time into absorbing the knowledge as opposed to putting it into practice was my biggest setback. Consistent, surface-level action at the very minimum is required. If you're not getting inspired by continuously not creating, then you might as well continuously create and still be uninspired. You'll at least have something to show for it. This is a problem I suffered from for over a *decade.* It's not symptomatic of who you are as a person, believe me, but rather a simple side effect of the unknown unknown.

I have discovered that inspiration appears almost exclusively as a byproduct of establishing creative "frameworks" which you can rely on to produce and refine new ideas. Some magical, pre-existing inspiration being the primary driver behind a "creatively fulfilled" artist is a nonsense idea. How well your inspiration is fulfilled is reflective of how well your creative frameworks support the scale and detail of your ideas.

As artists, we're constantly re-examining our creations at increasing levels of detail as the creation grows in complexity towards its final form. It is through *experimenting deep and wide* through each of these details, that inspiration strikes. Sometimes it strikes in the moment. Sometimes it strikes in the middle of a dream, or a bathroom break. Sometimes it takes sticking with an idea you have for long periods of time to really immerse yourself and prime your brain to think and create in a way that suits that idea, that story, that world, that universe.

Regardless of *where or when* it does strike, the worst kind of inspiration is the kind you have a *feeling* of, rather than a *knowing* of. You know, the kind that's grand and sweeping, but will inevitably be lost in some restless purgatory of unfulfilled ideas, abandoned by indecision, always a feeling, never concrete.

The *best* kind of inspiration to be struck by is the *actionable* kind. The kind you know *exactly* how to bring into reality, down to the fine details. Having the ability to easily build a game plan in your head that fulfills your creative needs elicits a certain magnitude of resolve that *only* knowledge gained through experience can give you.

You can't force yourself to be inspired. However, you *can* create a garden that grows inspiration. Truthfully, a garden *must* exist for such delicate seeds to grow, and the gardener must build the garden well and see to its regular upkeep. First, you must understand that inspiration is in fact the seeds and not the water, nor the garden, nor the gardener. It's the culmination of the gardener's dedication, the garden walls keeping out unwanted visitors, the fertility of the soil, the plentiful supply of water, and a keen eye for weeds that need pulling which ultimately allows the seeds to grow and flourish.

I'm here to help you envision an garden that grows new ideas, built upon what I believe is *the most universal* framework for creation of any kind. Context. A perfectly infinite, magic box for plugging ideas into and getting ideas out of. Creating effectively isn't just for the master-level, ten thousand hours plus type creator.

I’d wager that if we can become more effective at building these contextual gardens, then we will *inevitably* grow more seeds of creativity, knowledge, inspiration, and joy both as artists and as people. Allow me to blow your friggin’ mind, dude.

# My Backstory #Review

But first, if you’ve never seen my face before, my name is Robert. If you’re a new subscriber coming over from my podcast -

WHO IS TELLING YOU ABOUT THIS? HOW ARE YOU FINDING ME?

Bet ya didn’t know that I’m a real music producer, huh?

I started producing in Reason 4 in 2010, which I used to produce most of my first album over the next two years. By 2011, I was looking to try out new DAWs to see if I couldn’t have a smoother songwriting experience outside of Reason.

I picked up FL Studio and I wrote like *one song* that made it onto that album I just mentioned. I dropped out of my senior year of high school to finish writing and mixing the album before it eventually dropped in October of 2012.

Feel free to check it out, but I warn you, it’s definitely a product of its time. After dropping that project, I was only more hungry to learn as much as I could, so I picked up Ableton, which I’ve been using as my primary creation environment for 10 years now, holy shit. Anyway, enough about me, back to the topic at hand here.

# It's Definitely Not Nothing #Review

Meriam-Webster’s online dictionary defines context as a few different things *depending on the context*,

> 🔊 *`Insert way overdone maniacal laughing`*

but for the sake of this discussion, I’ve chosen the following definition:

> 👁️ `“The interrelated conditions in which something exists or occurs”`

Sounds boring, but let's do what people do in video essays and extrapolate the shit out of this.

The first key word here is "something". We're talking about *nouns* here, folks. People, places, things, ideas, events. From here on out, we'll just refer to the *entire* realm of things that exist or occur simply as "data" or "things".

> 👁️ *`I think, therefore I am.`*

# Attribution Constitution #Review

Next key word here is *conditions,* which can't *really* be mentioned without bringing up attributes as well. You'll see what I mean in a second here. In English, a condition and and attribute are defined very similarly, with one definition hinging upon *qualities* and the other upon *characteristics*, so I'd like to set this up in a simple way, and illustrate the reliance of one upon on the other. Let's start with attributes.

---

Attributes are:

> 👁️ `"A quality or feature regarded as a characteristic or inherent part of someone or something."`

In other words, an aspect of *what* something is. Assuming we want to change *what something is*, we could potentially *add or remove* attributes to it that fundamentally re-define what it is.

For example, adding a planet into the background of a digital painting might fundamentally change *what genre* the painting is from fantasy to sci-fi, or adding another oscillator to your synth patch may fundamentally alter *what kind* of sound we'd categorize it as based on the timbre or pitch having changed.

---

Conditions are…

> 👁️ `"The state of something with regard to its appearance, quality, or working order."`

In other words, an aspect of *how* something is, and for our purposes, *how we want it to be*. Assuming we want to change *how something is,* we can *modify the state* of its existing attributes to suit our needs.

For example, changing the color of the background in your digital painting could change *how* the overall image feels, or turning up the distortion on your song's lead vocal could change *how clearly* it cuts through the other sounds in the mix.

The differences between *what* and *how* can be subjective and often times both occupy the same exact space at the same time depending on how you frame it, so I'll leave that up to you.

---

In the case of sounds, they could be *dynamic,* or *lush,* or *uplifting,* or *comforting,* or-

> 🔊 `DAMN SON, WHERE'D YOU FIND THIS?.mp3`

Ooh, sorry about that, accidentally hit my sound board. I guess that still qualifies, though. Anyway, sounds can have all sorts of wonderful attributes and conditions.

In the case of people, we often mislabel our transient, conditional states of mind as being attributes that determine our worth and the *very essence of who we are,* but rarely consider that others frequently see us as *dynamic,* or *lush,* or *uplifting,* or *comforting,* or-

> 🔊 `DAMN SON, WHERE'D YOU-`

Yes, *that too.* You're a piece of work, don't you forget it.

> 🎞️ *`Alex Jones saying "You god damn son of a bitch"`*

> 👁️ *`I think I'm shitty, therefore I am shitty.`*

# Category 5 Brain Pain #Review

There are five categories that every attribute and condition you can imagine generally fits into. These are prerequisites, modifiers, qualifiers, states of mind, and states of being.

Yep, unlimited brain pain.

To fix that, we need to be able to understand these types of attributes and conditions so we can generalize our knowledge enough to work out what's at play in nearly any situation.

---

Let's start with prerequisites.

> 👁️ `“Something essential to the appearance or occurrence of something else, such as an environmental requirement”`

---

Then we have modifiers and qualifiers.

> 👁️ `“A restricting or modifying factor, a qualification”`

These are functionally similar and could be interchangeable depending on how you like to modify and qualify.

---

Next is temper of mind.

> 👁️ `“Temper of mind”`

To me, this means your *view of reality* as filtered by your personal biases, which affect your decisions to *take certain actions*. It’s a lifelong set of personal "umbrella" attributes and conditions that you use to determine which relationships to form. You adopt or internalize them over the course of your entire life by gathering context from relationships you’ve experienced previously.

---

This last one is where things get *pretty* wild.

> 👁️ `“A state of being”`

> 🎞️ *`"You can tell that it’s an aspen tree because of the way that it is.”`*

Yeeeaaah. We know what metaphysics is over here, don't we? Right, don't we? Yeah, so, all of that. The whole thing. All of every possible description of every thing that does or ever will exist. Just in case you thought we were starting to build up some kind of sensible structure here, this one has to go and send us way off into the abstract. *Actually, though, this is what we want.* The ability to come up with attributes and conditions *out of complete nonsense, thin air copium* is what *makes artists artists.* That's the imagination at work, baby!

# Sorry, Can't Relate #Review

**The last key word here is *interrelated.***

A relation is defined as:

> 👁️ `“An aspect or quality that connects two or more things or parts as being or belonging or working together or as being of the same kind”`

By knowing the attributes (aspects or qualities) of our *things*, we know if and how they are related. By utilizing conditions, we can determine whether or not that relationship is useful to us.

For example, I believe that the earth is round-

> 🎞️ *`Neil Degrasse Tyson saying "oblong spheroid"`*

*Shut the FUCK UP, Neil.* I also know that my friend *"Timmy"* is a flat earther because it's been well expressed over many long, *incredibly* frustrating conversations. One of the relationships between us is based on a certain *attribute* - which shape we believe the Earth is, and it is *not useful* because we *don't fucking agree.* Agreeing would be useful because I wouldn't have to fuckin' *hear it every time we hang out,* and would ultimately serve the desired goal of *deradicalizing Timmy.*

However, sometimes we deliberately look for certain relationships to be useless as a way to verify the need for other attributes, conditions, or relationships. Usefulness is what you make of it.

Like when you say water is wet and Timmy says that water *isn't* wet, and that it *wets instead.* This requires you to create the necessary conditions to prove to Timmy that water *is indeed wet*. So you go to the nearest largeish body of water to perform a case study. Timmy's resulting silence (as he sinks to the bottom of the river) is, for all intents and purposes, an admission of his incorrectness, and thus a more *useful* relationship is formed. Of course *they* found out that water is wet *and it wets.*

# Group Therapy #Rewrite

Now, context is the definition I mentioned before…

> 👁️ `“The interrelated conditions in which something exists or occurs”`

but *"contexts"* can also be thought of as the tangible frameworks or structures we use to *get the information we want.*

"Contexts" are assorted groups of data and tools. How these things are grouped depends solely on what workflow you're trying to engage in.

This might also be called a view, a workspace, or just a space by some people. They're used to examine *things* for relationships which may inform changes we want to make to other data, attributes, or relationships, or even create new *things* altogether.

We can consider any particular task or workflow we're trying to achieve, then use whatever constraints are available to us to observe the attributes of the relevant data *in action.*

I use Obsidian to write scripts, it's a great tool that you should absolutely look into, but my point is that the script for *this video* was written inside of a "context" I have set up for *writing scripts.* It's a canvas in Obsidian that only shows me links to script notes that I've marked as "Draft" and as "Pinned", and an outline of my headings when I open the script. It's designed for the workflow of quickly prioritizing what I should be working on.

*That's it.* Pure focus on the task at hand.

# Idea Machines #Idea

> ==*Elaborate on several examples of creative based contexts…*==

# Cascading Contexts #Editing

Which came first, the chicken or the egg?

You’ll find that any context could be considered as a data point in a context of contexts. You can nest contexts inside of other contexts and add attributes, conditions, and relationships at different nest levels.

> ==*Elaborate on tiered levels of context…*==

It’s all a matter of how you need to view or process data. Can it can reasonably be done? How prepared you are to wrestle with contexts potentially affecting contexts inside of them? If we can theoretically nest contexts of data inside of each other infinitely, how do we know where to create the first point of reference to build everything else from? How do we know when our contexts are doing their job, and when nesting them negatively impacts our work? One word:

# Use Your Insight Voice #Editing

Insight.

> 👁️ `"The capacity to gain an accurate and deep intuitive understanding of a person or thing."`

To me, this is the least clearly defined aspect of this whole formula so far. I think to be reductionist, we can say that insight is intuitive understanding of how to engage with *ideas,* including the *idea* of who you believe a person is.

Regardless, context is needed. Either a lot of it, or a significant enough experience for something to to become intuitive enough to feel like insight. I'd make the argument, however, that context acquired through tangible data is significantly more effective at producing results than context acquired through inferring and not taking action.

# A Music Production Example #Editing

In music production, the rules of how data and attributes are presented and managed are not so structured, so we have to get a little more creative to set up areas in our DAW that serve as dedicated contexts for accomplishing certain workflows where a context isn't already built into the software to do that thing. Like one for managing our low frequency content, for example, or controlling all of our FX from one spot.

We want a relationship between our kick and our bass that improves the low-end frequencies of our song’s mix. The sounds of the kick and the bass are our pieces of data. We know that the kick and bass are related by several *attributes,* but one most importantly, that being that both the kick and the bass are *low frequency audio.* Our *condition* is that they should both positively contribute to the overall low frequencies of the song when playing at the same time. We’ll use this condition to guide the formation of the desired relationship between the kick and bass.

The goal, then, is to create a context that has the right tools for listening and analyzing *low frequency audio* to determine if the relationship between the kick and bass is benefitting the mix of the song.

To create the context in our DAW, we might group only our kick and bass tracks such that they sum together. Now they’re grouped or related not just in description, but in a tangible way we can actually work with. From here we can assess our data through several means.

First, we can use tools that help us understand the relationship between the kick and bass better, like an oscilloscope *(Shaperbox 3 is great)*, a spectrum analyzer, an EQ or filter to preview just the low frequencies, and a tool to solo the mono and stereo signals individually. We can go so far as creating useful presets for these tools, and building them into our project templates

Once our kick and sub sound good together, we can then use that context as a piece of data in another context or relationship.
