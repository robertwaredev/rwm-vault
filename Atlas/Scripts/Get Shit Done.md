# The Premise

- Why am I making this video and who is it for?
- This is for people with a general sense of aimlessness, impostor syndrome, and a constant anxiety that you're wasting your potential as a result.
- I'm making this video because I want to help people who have struggled with mental illness and self worth issues from a young age to late into life.
- This is a implementation oriented video about how to understand yourself

# The Problem

- How I struggled with making a productivity system that worked for me.
- Lack of motivation, brain fog

# The Path

- Systems for capturing inputs
- Time management, then money

# The Process

- How to understand generally what you want to accomplish and where you commonly encounter problems.
- Understand what commonly holds you back.
- Observe and document common responses or outcomes when you try to do things normally.
- How to introduce systems and elements into your life to create a desired response.
- Frameworks of thinking and physical mechanisms to trigger them.
- Determine causes for these outcomes and create a ‘sequence break’ that implements a system to process that information and a trigger to activate it.

# The Potential

- Regain control of your inner monologue by offloading thoughts to a storage system.
