# OPEN: OUTDOOR DINING TABLE - DAY

> Close up of up me sitting at a table outside with new friends, not paying much attention. Muted conversation in the background.

> **Other Person**

Hey Robert, what do you do for a living?

> **Robert**

Hm? Oh, uhhh, I’m a music producer.

> **Other Person**

Oh, really? That’s pretty awesome!

> **Robert**

You think so?

> **Other Person**

Yeah man, you get to do something you love all day?

> **Other Person**

>> *Grinning, as if the next words are going to be relatable somehow.*

My job is literally sticking my *whole arm* up horses’ asses.

> **Robert**
>
>>*Expressionless, extended pause as I wait (too long) for them to fill me in*

You mean like -

> **Other Person**

Like *all the way* up there*.*

> **Robert**

>> *Nodding as if this makes perfect sense.*

Nice.

> **Other Person**

>> *Contemplating hard and then snapping fingers as if remembering something long lost.*

Oh, do you like it?

> **Robert**
>
>> *Unsure, assuming we’re still talking about work.*

My job? Oh, uhhh…

# CUT TO: SUBURBAN HOME, BACKYARD - DAY

> Outside of the house, peaceful (nature sounds)

 **Robert**

>> *(muted sound)*

FUUUUUUUUUCK!

## INSIDE HOUSE, STUDIO INTERIOR

> *Robert is screaming at a laptop.*

**Robert:**

> *We’re talking deleted albums worth of disbelief and anger*

FUCK! FUCK! FUCK!

**Robert:**

> *Running out of breath, violently shaking the computer as if shaking every baby in a great enemy’s entire lineage.*

FUCK YOOOOOUUU ABLETON, FUCK YOU!

> Pushes back laptop dramatically and falls back into chair. Extended pause to breathe and dissociate for several seconds. “Snaps out of it” by abruptly wiping nose like a three year old and calmly moving forward.

# CUT TO: OUTDOOR DINING TABLE - DAY

> *Back to the original conversation.*

**Robert:**

> *Realizing his job isn't horse-assery*

Yeah, wouldn’t trade it for the world, you?
